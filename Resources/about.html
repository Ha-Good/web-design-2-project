    <h2>About The Star</h2>

    <div class="about-the-star">  
      <img src="/Images/About-the-star-1.jpeg">
      <p>Hazel, a beautiful calico cat, was rescued by the Stray Cat Rescue Network from a garbage dump in Alymer. Her previous life had been one of hardship, living off scraps and fighting for survival. But thanks to the network's intervention, Hazel was given a second chance at a happy life. She was taken to a foster home where she received plenty of love and care, and was eventually adopted by a loving family. Now, Hazel spends her days lounging in the sun, playing with her favorite toys, and getting plenty of cuddles from her new family. Her story is a testament to her incredible ability to grow under any conditions.</p>

      <p>As a calico cat, Hazel has a playful and curious personality, and she's been known to indulge in some unusual snacks, including Cheetos. Whenever her owner opens a bag, Hazel comes running and eagerly sniffs around, hoping for a taste. She seems to particularly enjoy the cheesy flavor and the satisfying crunch of the snack. Of course, her owner only lets her have a few bites as a special treat - after all, Cheetos aren't exactly a part of a cat's natural diet.(And definitely not because she is technically 13lbs) </p>

      <h3>HMG</h3>
      <p>The owner of Hazel, a beloved calico cat, is a passionate graphic designer who spends countless hours working on their craft. To fuel their creativity, they drink a lot of coffee, often trying out different blends and brewing methods. Hazel loves to curl up next to them as they work, sometimes even napping on the keyboard. Despite the occasional spill or paw on the trackpad, Hazel is a constant source of inspiration and comfort for their owner, helping them stay focused and motivated throughout long design sessions. </p>

      <h3>Llama!</h3>
      <p>The toy's soft, furry texture and fun shape make it the perfect toy  for Hazel, who loves to pounce on it and carry it around the house. The llama toy has become a fixture in Hazel's playtime routine, and her owner enjoys watching her have so much fun with it. It's clear that this llama toy has won over Hazel's heart, and it's sure to provide hours of entertainment for both her and her owner.

      <h3>Birds Outside the Window</h3>
      <p>Despite her best efforts to catch them, the birds always manage to fly away just in time, leaving Hazel frustrated but determined. Her owner enjoys watching Hazel's reactions to the birds' antics, and often wonders who is really in charge of the entertainment - the birds or Hazel. </p>
